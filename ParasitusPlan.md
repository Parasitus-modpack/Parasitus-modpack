# Parasitus Modpack Plan

## Parasitus Fixes Code To Do

**Source Code:** https://github.com/suichanwa/Parasitus-Modpack-Fix-utiltiy

## Small Idea

### First-Time World Load Screen

When the player makes the world and loads in FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLY, a screen will pop up with image and start button:

> "The earth heals, yet we decay.
> 
> 5 years has passed
> 
> You are not new here."
> 
> [Image here]
> 
> [Button to let player start playing "Survive"]

(This should not pop up again in same world, if possible per player)

## To Do List For Myself

- When making server file, remove ExtendPolyphonyLimit

- Make implants not lost upon death gamerule default via craft tweaker or smth

- When adding new deco blocks make some chests old chests

- Write down and put lore book in new zombie lab structure and a lore book in existing military structure

- Convert the broadcast structure from online to the pack and the 2 giant military ship replacement

- Test hordes still work after srp updates as well

- A rare spawn, armored truck with soldiers being attacked by basic parasites

- I should adjust the existing plane to make it look more like it crashed then a poorly buried plane that is intact

- Adjust wrench description to mention it can interact with other pipes
