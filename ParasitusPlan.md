## Detailed Explanation of the Above Points

**Better Placement Mod**
Fix being able to click seats through doors (While opening doors, was very annoying) caused by "better placement" mod

**Rebalance 7dtm**
the damage done by all 7dtm blocks and tools are too OP
- [ ] Flame turret
- [ ] Metal spikes
- [ ] Wooden spikes
- [ ] Barbed wire
- [ ] Auger
- [ ] Others?

**Techguns CE**
copy items/code from CE for the modpack
- [ ] Camo
- [ ] Fixes an issue where techguns gunfire audio only coming out of left speaker/headphone
    - I am not exactly sure what the sound issue is in original techguns or if they did directly fix it.
    - **Reference:** [TheSlize/Techguns2-Completion-Update](https://github.com/TheSlize/Techguns2-Completion-Update)
- [ ] Also take Techgun CE gun HUD ammo ui (each gun has its own art for this part too)

**To Do List For the owner**

- When making server file, remove ExtendPolyphonyLimit

- Make implants not lost upon death gamerule default via craft tweaker or smth

- When adding new deco blocks make some chests old chests

- Write down and put lore book in new zombie lab structure and a lore book in existing military structure

- Convert the broadcast structure from online to the pack and the 2 giant military ship replacement

- Test hordes still work after srp updates as well
