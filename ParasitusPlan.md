## Detailed Explanation of the Above Points

**Better Placement Mod**
Fix being able to click seats through doors (While opening doors, was very annoying) caused by "better placement" mod

**Rebalance 7dtm**
the damage done by all 7dtm blocks and tools are too OP
- [ ] Flame turret
- [ ] Metal spikes
- [ ] Wooden spikes
- [ ] Barbed wire
- [ ] Auger
- [ ] Others?


-If your y level is 163 blocks or higher, techgun attack helicopter spawn

The message appears "Restricted altitude exceeded. Intercepting aircraft inbound."

If player goes below 162 it despawns

**Techguns CE**
copy items/code from CE for the modpack
- [ ] Camo
- [ ] Fixes an issue where techguns gunfire audio only coming out of left speaker/headphone
    - I am not exactly sure what the sound issue is in original techguns or if they did directly fix it.
    - **Reference:** [TheSlize/Techguns2-Completion-Update](https://github.com/TheSlize/Techguns2-Completion-Update)
- [ ] Also take Techgun CE gun HUD ammo ui (each gun has its own art for this part too)

**Startup Text**
When the player makes the world and loads in FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLY, a screen will pop up with image and start button:

> "The earth heals, yet we decay.
> 5 years has passed
> You are not new here."
> [Image here]
> [Button to let player start playing "Survive"]
(This should not pop up again in same world, if possible per player)

**City Generation**
